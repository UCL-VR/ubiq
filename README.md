Ubiq is a Unity networking library for research, teaching and development, maintained by the Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics group at UCL.
Ubiq is 100% free and open source.

## Features

Ubiq's goal is to enable your networked project. It includes message passing, room management, rendezvous and matchmaking, object spawning, shared binary blobs, multiple synchronisation models, lighweight XR interaction examples, customisable avatars and voice chat across Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS, and Javascript running in the browser.

## For Researchers

Instructions for setting up your own server are included. Ubiq does not rely on any third-party services, making it GDPR-safe for your experiments.

## Supported Unity Versions

Ubiq supports Unity 2021.3.22 LTS or later. The samples and default avatars support the Universal Render Pipeline. 

If you are building for WebXR, we recommend using Unity 6. If your project requires Unity 2022, bear in mind there is an [issue](https://github.com/De-Panther/unity-webxr-export/issues/367) with minor releases after 2022.3.16.

## Quick Start

1. Add Ubiq using the UPM, with the ["Install package from git url..."]((https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html)) option:
```
https://github.com/UCL-VR/ubiq.git#upm
```

2. Select Ubiq from the package list and import the *Demo (XRI)* sample.

3. Open the `Assets/Samples/Ubiq/x.y.z/Demo (XRI)/Demo.unity` scene.

4. Click `Play`.

You're connected! For next steps see the Getting Started guide in our docs at https://ucl-vr.github.io/ubiq/.
