This folder contains a sample XR avatar sourced from the ReadyPlayerMe public [repository](https://github.com/readyplayerme/rpm-unity-sdk-core/) (commit 6310fde).

To avoid external dependencies the avatar has been converted to FBX format. Its materials have been converted to use a Ubiq PBR shadergraph which targets URP and BiRP.

This sample avatar is provided so you can quickly check whether this kind of avatar might be a good fit for your application, without needing to first import the various ReadyPlayerMe dependencies built for runtime loading. If you do want more avatars in this style, you can use the ReadyPlayerMe character creator to generate new avatars and treat this avatar as a template. 

Alternatively, Ubiq comes with a ReadyPlayerMe sample which supports runtime loading from an URL. This sample will import the ReadyPlayerMe package and dependencies.
