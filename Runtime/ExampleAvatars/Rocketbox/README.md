This folder contains a sample XR avatar sourced from the Rocketbox public [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox/) (commit 0943055).

Its materials have been converted to use a Ubiq PBR shadergraph which targets URP and BiRP.

This sample avatar is provided so you can quickly check whether this kind of avatar might be a good fit for your application, without needing to import the full Rocketbox package.
