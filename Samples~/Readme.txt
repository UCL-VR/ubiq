The Samples folder demonstrates how to use Ubiq.

The Start Here scene is where to begin - it contains a social application which uses almost all of Ubiq's features.

The Samples reference two assets: Nexus and Sample Room. These define which server to connect to, and which room to join. When you first open the project, the Sample Room will generate a unique Guid for your project which all the Samples will connect to. You can change this at any time by editing the Sample Room Asset in the Inspector.

The Boids folder contains an example of a networked application without the additional functionality in the social sample (Avatars, UI, etc).

The Bots folder contains an example of a scene running an automated agent - a Bot - as well as a command and control system to instantiate many Bots across multiple computers.

The MinimalExamples folder contains very minimalist examples focusing on one feature each, so you can see that features code in isolation, though they are not as flexible as the more complete Samples typically do not work in VR.

All of the assets in the samples are CC0, meaning you can re-use them as you wish, including in closed source & commercial products.
