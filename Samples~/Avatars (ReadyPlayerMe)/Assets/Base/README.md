We suggest you DO NOT use the base prefab in this folder. 

Instead, use the variant in the folder above, and replace/overwrite this base prefab when updating Ubiq.

The changes you have made in your variant will then be re-applied to the updated base. This means as long as the base prefab has not changed too much, you'll be able to update your prefab too!
