// The Ubiq Package contains a set of NodeJs classes and functions
// for interacting with the Ubiq Messaging layer.
// This package supports establishing, or listening for, a connection
// to a Ubiq Peer and exchanging Ubiq Messages with it. It also includes
// Helper functions, such as those for creating Unique Identifiers.
// This package is part of the Ubiq Server, but can also be used to
// build NodeJs based (Client) Peers.
